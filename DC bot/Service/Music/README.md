## Root Files

### LavaLinkService.cs

**Purpose:** Facade for Lavalink audio server and music playback operations.

**Implements:** `ILavaLinkService`

**Key Methods:**

- `ConnectAsync()` - Connect to Lavalink server
- `PlayAsyncUrl()` - Play track from URL
- `PlayAsyncQuery()` - Play track from search query
- `PauseAsync()` - Pause current track
- `ResumeAsync()` - Resume paused track
- `SkipAsync()` - Skip to next track
- `StartPlayingQueue()` - Join voice channel and start queue
- `LeaveVoiceChannel()` - Disconnect from voice
- `Init()` - Initialize guild state

**Events:**

- `TrackStarted` - Fired when track begins playing. The event publishes the target text channel and embed; `ReactionHandler` captures the `DiscordClient` when it registers.

**Architecture:**

- Delegates to specialized services for specific tasks
- Uses `ILavalinkNodeConnectionService` for node connection lifecycle
- Uses `IPlaybackRequestService` for URL/query play request orchestration
- Uses `IPlaybackControlService` for pause/resume/skip/leave behavior
- Uses `IPlayerConnectionService` for voice channel management
- Uses `ITrackPlaybackService` for queue track playback
- Uses `IPlaybackEventHandlerService` for event handling
- Uses `IMusicQueueService` for queue management and repeat-list queue rehydration

### TrackSearchResolverService.cs

**Purpose:** Resolve search queries and URLs to appropriate search modes.

**Implements:** `ITrackSearchResolverService`

**Method:**

- `ResolveSearchMode()` - Determine search mode from input string

**Supported Prefixes:**

- `spotify:` or `sptfy:` → Spotify
- `soundcloud:` or `scsearch:` → SoundCloud
- `youtubemusic:` or `ytmsearch:` → YouTube Music
- `youtube:` or `ytsearch:` → YouTube
- `applemusic:` or `amsearch:` → Apple Music
- `deezer:` or `dzsearch:` → Deezer
- `yandexmusic:` or `ymsearch:` → Yandex Music
- `bandcamp:` or `bcsearch:` → Bandcamp

**Default Search Mode:**

- Configurable via `SearchResolverOptions`
- Falls back to YouTube if not specified

For absolute URLs, the resolver also maps known hosts such as YouTube, YouTube Music, SoundCloud, Spotify, Apple Music,
Deezer, Yandex Music, and Bandcamp. Unknown absolute URLs resolve to `TrackSearchMode.None`.
